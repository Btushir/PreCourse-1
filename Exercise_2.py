"""
Stack is a type of LIFO (Last in First Out) data structure meaning element
added at the end of stack is processed first. There are multiple operations that can be performed on the stack.
(1) push element to stack (2) pop element from stack (3) peek element from stack (4) get size of stack and more.
This program implement stack using Linked List and perform operations such as push, pop.
